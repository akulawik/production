Feature: manual adjustments of demand

  sub domain: demand forecasting
  keeps track of current and future customer needs for our products

  Domain story:
  Adjust demand at day to amount, delivered.
  >> demand.adjust(productRefNo, atDay, amount)
  We can change only Demands for today and future.

  Data from call-off document should be preserved (DONâ€™T OVERRIDE THEM).
  Adjust demand should be possible even
  if there was no call-off document for that product.
  In standard case future call-off documents should be stronger (overrides) adjustment,
  but if customer warn us about opposite case import of call-off document should not remove previous adjustments.

  New demand is stored for further reference
  emit domain event demand changed

  Logistician note should be kept along with adjustment.

  outside of context boundary:
  If new demand is not fulfilled by
  current product stock and production forecast
  there is a shortage in particular days and we need to rise an alert.
  planner should be notified,

  if there are locked parts on stock,
  QA task for recovering them should have high priority.

  Scenario: demand increased but fulfilled by current stock level
    Given demand for product refNo "3009000":
      | 0 | 100 | 300 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
    When demand of refNo "3009000" is adjusted for "tomorrow" to 400
    Then demand is changed to 400
    Then current demands are
      | 0 | 400 | 300 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
    Then no shortage was found
    Given current stock of proper parts of refNo "3009000" is 750

  Scenario: demand increased, shortage is found
    Given demand for product refNo "3009000":
      | 0 | 100 | 300 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
    Given no production of refNo "3009000" is planned
    Given current stock of proper parts of refNo "3009000" is 350
    When demand of refNo "3009000" is adjusted for "tomorrow" to 400
    Then demand is changed
    Then shortage of 250 parts for "day after tomorrow" is found
    Then current demands are

  Scenario: demand increased, but stock forecast including production will be enough
    Given demand for product refNo "3009000":

    Given planned production of refNo "3009000":
      | 300 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
    Given current stock of proper parts of refNo "3009000" is 450
    When demand of refNo "3009000" is adjusted for "tomorrow" to 400
    Then demand is changed

      | 0 | 400 | 300 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

  Scenario: next call-off will be stronger than adjustment
    Given demand for product refNo "3009000":
      | 0 | 100 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
    When demand of refNo "3009000" is adjusted for "tomorrow" to 400
    Then demand is changed
    When new call-off document for product refNo "3009000" contains:
      | 0 | 100 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
    Then demand is not changed

    Given demand for product refNo "3009000":
      | 0 | 100 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
    When demand of refNo "3009000" is strongly adjusted for "tomorrow" to 400
    Then demand is changed
    When new call-off document for product refNo "3009000" contains:
      | 0 | 100 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
    Then demand is changed
    Then current demands are
      | 0 | 400 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

    Given demand for product refNo "3009000":
      | 0 | 100 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
    When demand of refNo "3009000" is strongly adjusted for "tomorrow" to 400
    Then demand is changed
    When new call-off document for product refNo "3009000" contains:
      | 0 | 600 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
    Then review request is shown on report [demand for refNo "3009000" was 100, adjusted to 400, but call-off has 600]
